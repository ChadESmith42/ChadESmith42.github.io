## [Coding By Chad](https://codingbychad.com)

Coding By Chad was originally created while I attened the [Centriq Career Training Program's](https://centriq.com) Full-Stack Web 
Developer program during the summer of 2018. The original site was created as an ASP.NET MVC site. After taking my first full-time
developer job(!!!), I began working with Angular(2+) and Angular's Material Design. I decided to recreate my portfolio site as an Angular
Application.

### Constant revision, addition, and refactoring
Judge lightly. This site is constantly changing. I don't always have time to tinker with it as other projects, work, and non-coding
activities often leave me with limited time.

I do welcome pull requests, bug reports, enhancement suggestions, and any feedback you may care to provide. I firmly believe in the 
charity and generosity of the developer community. Any help is always appreciated. I'll try to answer any questions you may have if I've
solved a problem you're currently struggling with in your own code.

## Hosting Via Azure
Rather than host via GitHub Pages, I chose to host this site as an Azure static website. I chose to do so mostly so I could learn more
about Azure and managing that process. Some of my other projects require a back-end database, so using Azure to host everything under my
domain seems like the best solution for me.
